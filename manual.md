# Game Manual

Welcome to WebSim! This manual provides an overview of gameplay, controls, units, and structures to help you get started.

## 1. Basic Controls

Mastering the controls is the first step to victory.

*   **Camera Pan**: Use the **W, A, S, D** keys or the **Arrow Keys**. You can also pan by holding the **Middle Mouse Button** and dragging.
*   **Camera Rotation**: Use the **Q** and **E** keys to rotate the camera left and right.
*   **Camera Zoom**: Use the **Mouse Wheel** to zoom in and out.
*   **Select Unit/Building**: **Left-Click** on a unit or building.
*   **Select Multiple Units**: **Left-Click and Drag** to create a selection box.
*   **Issue Command**: **Right-Click** on a location or target to issue a context-sensitive command (move, attack, gather, repair) to your selected units.
*   **Pause Menu**: Press the **Backquote** (`) key during a game to pause and access the in-game menu.

## 2. Gameplay Fundamentals

Your primary goal is to manage resources, build a base, train an army, and overwhelm your opponent.

### Resources

There are two primary resources:

*   **Minerals** (Blue Crystals): Harvested by SCVs from Mineral Fields. Used for constructing most buildings and training basic units.
*   **Vespene Gas** (Green Geyser): Harvested by SCVs from a Refinery built on top of a Vespene Geyser. Required for advanced units, buildings, and upgrades.

### Supply

Every unit you train consumes supply. You must build **Supply Depots** to increase your supply capacity. If you reach your supply cap, you cannot train more units. Keep an eye on the supply count in the top-right corner of the screen.

### Technology Tree (Teching)

To access more powerful units and upgrades, you must construct specific buildings. This is known as "teching up". For example, to train a Medic, you must first have a Barracks and an Academy.
