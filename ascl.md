# üß† ASCL: Agent Shorthand Change Log Format

The **Agent Shorthand Change Log (ASCL)** is a specialized logging syntax designed for agent-to-agent communication. It is a minimalistic, structured, and timestamped system for documenting changes in a software ecosystem. ASCL is not optimized for human readability but rather for agent parsing, syncing, and diffing across distributed or automated environments.

---

## üîß Purpose

ASCL enables:

* Rapid, structured, and trackable logging of changes.
* Minimal parsing overhead.
* Consistent schema for change monitoring, synchronization, and rollback.
* Zero-ambiguity syntax for automated audits, syncs, migrations, and intelligent rollback decisions.

---

## üî¢ Format Structure

Each ASCL entry follows this base format:

```text
[TS] MMDDYY-HHMM | [MOD] <module> | [ACT] <action> | [TGT] <target> | [VAL] <value> | [REF] <reference>
```

### üèõÔ∏è Field Definitions:

| Tag     | Meaning                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `[TS]`  | **Current timestamp** of the change (MMDDYY-HHMM, 24-hour clock). This must be accurate to the time of the log entry. |
| `[MOD]` | Module or subsystem the change was made in       |
| `[ACT]` | Action taken (e.g., add, remove, modify)         |
| `[TGT]` | Target item that was acted upon                  |
| `[VAL]` | Specific values/parameters related to the change |
| `[REF]` | Reference to exact file path and/or line number  |

---

## üìä Action Codes (`[ACT]`)

To ensure full support across HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and Python, ASCL supports the following actions:

### General Actions

### JS/PHP/Python-Specific

| Code     | Description                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |

## üìí Example Entries

```text
[TS] 062824-1301 | [MOD] html_ui | [ACT] +TAG | [TGT] <section class="hero"> | [VAL] id=home | [REF] index.html:22

## ü™® Advanced Tags (Optional)

These optional tags support future extensibility:

| Tag     | Purpose                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `[SEC]` | Security-related context or classification |
| `[DB]`  | Database context or table affected         |
| `[VER]` | Version or build context                   |

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Parsing Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
def parse_ascl(entry):
    data = {}
    for part in entry.split(" | "):
        if not part.strip():
            continue
        key, val = part.split("] ", 1)
        data[key.strip("[")] = val.strip()
    return data

entry = "[TS] 062824-1305 | [MOD] comms_api | [ACT] ^FUNC | [TGT] transmitPacket | [VAL] addedRetry=true timeout=200ms | [REF] comms.js:104"
parsed = parse_ascl(entry)
print(parsed['TGT'])  # Output: transmitPacket
```

## üöÄ Use Cases

* Agent-to-agent communication during CI/CD deployments.
* Local-only changelog documentation for generated files.
* Synchronization of logic/data changes across distributed AI services.
* Tracking of function/data evolution in projects with limited human intervention.
* Rollback, replay, or diff generation for agent-maintained systems.
* Language-agnostic documentation of granular codebase evolution.

## üìÜ Timestamp Format Spec

The timestamp format `MMDDYY-HHMM` includes both date and time components.

| Field | Format                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| MM    | 2-digit month (e.g., 06 = June)    |
| DD    | 2-digit day (e.g., 28)             |
| YY    | 2-digit year (e.g., 24 = 2024)     |
| HHMM  | 24-hour time (e.g., 1305 = 1:05pm) |

---

## üìÑ Template

```
[TS] <MMDDYY-HHMM>
[MOD] <module_name>
[ACT] <action_code>
[TGT] <target_changed>
[VAL] <comma-separated key=value>
[REF] <file_path[:line]>
```

ASCL is meant to evolve with your agents. Let humans write paragraphs. Let agents speak in protocol.
